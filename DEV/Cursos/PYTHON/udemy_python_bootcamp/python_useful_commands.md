## Working with Requirements 
You can create **requirements.txt** file with all packages required to execute the program configured
- Here is an example of data that can be configured in that file 
```
    python-dateutil==2.8.2
    redis==5.0.0
    requests==2.31.0
    pip==24.2
```

After that, when you clone the repo again, you donÂ´t need to configure everything again
- To install all packages required to use the repo with the virtual environment activated, execute the following command:
> pip install -r requirements.txt
